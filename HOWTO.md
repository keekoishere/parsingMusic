Scrape data

go to music review site -> open clickable page -> check release date for 2024 -> parse artist + album name + year + parseRating -> save in DB -> repeat until end

Show data

just show data? order by artist name, release date, rating; filter by year, by pt, by rating

Front End :thinking:
